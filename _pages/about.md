I will join in [Zhejiang Lab](https://www.zhejianglab.com/) and [the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/) soon, I am now an associate professor working in [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Science (CAS)](http://english.cas.cn/). My research interests mainly concentrates around **fundamental AI**, including robust learning and graph representation with their practical applications in the fields of fundamental science.

Opening
======
I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate and graduate students with diverse background in mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, chemistry and biology, to work together on the reserach fields of **AI for Science**. We have opening positions available right now, including **full-time researcher, Engineer, Post Doc, Ph.D., and Interns** in the Zhejiang Lab and Zhejiang University.

I am also working closely with [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/), and looking for PhD/Mphil/RA/Postdoc interested in developing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms with their practical applications on AI-aided drug discovery, in CUHK. Feel free to drop me an <a href = "mailto: gychen@link.cuhk.edu.hk"> email </a> for more information or apply through the 
[official website](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/education/prospective-students/postgraduate-admissions-programmes/mphil-phd-programme) ([CUHK PhD Summer Workshop](http://hkpfs.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/) / [HKPFS](https://www.gs.cuhk.edu.hk/admissions/scholarships-fees/hkpfs) ).

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
